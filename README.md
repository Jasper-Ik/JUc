This single page non responsive site was design using external layout from 960.grid, using the link tag on the head
although flex box and grid seem to be the prodominant layout design invoke today external grid save you the stress of figuring out the whole page content by yourself 
using proper HTML selectors.
for the internal layout float was used to get item align to their various position.
 I had this peoject done after studying using of external grid to get easier result from the text which for me i beleive to be one the very best on HTML and CSS books
All the code was adapted from the Book "HTML and CSS" by JON DUCKETTE
